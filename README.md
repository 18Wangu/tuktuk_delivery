## 🎯 Key Features 
1. Real-Time Notifications via Push Protocol:  
   - Customers receive live updates on their order status, from preparation to delivery.  
   - Vendors and delivery drivers are notified of new orders or updates instantly.  

2. QR Code-Based Verification:  
   - Each food package includes a QR code that must be scanned upon delivery.  
   - The recipient signs a transaction on the blockchain to confirm receipt of their order.  
   - This eliminates issues like unauthorized pickups, ensuring only the rightful customer can claim the order.  

3. Conflict Resolution:  
   - Blockchain data helps identify the source of issues in disputes (e.g., order not received) by providing clear, tamper-proof records of each transaction.  
   - An **on-chain chat** via Push Protocol with tamper-proof messages ensures transparent communication and accountability during conflicts.  

4. User-Friendly Interface with Future Enhancements:  
   - Future Plans: Implementing account abstraction and gas sponsoring for a seamless user experience where users won’t even realize they are interacting with blockchain technology.  

Our solution not only optimizes the food delivery process but also addresses pain points of centralized platforms, offering a more equitable, efficient, and secure system for customers, vendors, and delivery drivers.

## 🚀 Features
Frontend:  
- Built with Next.js.  

Smart Contracts:  
- Written in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum Sepolia networks.  

Blockchain Interactions:  
- Integrated with **Ledger** for secure connection and transaction signing, providing an additional layer of safety for users.  

Analytics and Monitoring:  
- **Blockscout** is used to visualize past transactions and provide transparent tracking of all blockchain activities.  

**Push Protocol** Notifications:  
Push Protocol powers real-time updates to keep all stakeholders informed during the entire order process:  
- Order placed.  
- Food preparation started.  
- Order out for delivery.  
- Order delivered and confirmed.  

This combination of technologies enables us to deliver a decentralized platform that is transparent, secure, and user-friendly while effectively solving real-world challenges in food delivery.
